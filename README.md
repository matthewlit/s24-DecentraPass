## About The Project

**DecentraPass** is a decentralized password manager built on Web3, providing users with a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused way to store and manage their passwords in one location. It operates on the BNB testnet with tBNB as the native coin, using Solidity for smart contracts and thirdweb as a framework to connect user MetaMask wallets, utilize deployed smart contracts, and store data using IPFS.

## Tech Stack

- **NextJS**: Encompassing Framework
- **ReactJS**: Frontend Framework
- **NodeJS**: Backend
- **MetaMask**: Wallets
- **thridweb**: web3 Framework
- **GitHub**: Version Control

## Goals

- **Security**: Ensure user data is protected through decentralized encryption.
- **Privacy**: Empower users with control over their own data without relying on centralized servers.
- **Convenience**: Provide an easy-to-use interface for managing passwords securely.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Store passwords securely using IPFS, ensuring data is not held on any central server.
- **Smart Contracts**: Use Solidity-based smart contracts for secure password management and transactions.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Seamless connection with MetaMask wallets for authentication and data encryption.
- **Web3 Framework**: Leverage thirdweb for a robust connection to blockchain functionalities.

## Benefits
